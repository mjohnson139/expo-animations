# Expo Animation Showcase App - Overlay Animations Documentation

## Overview
The Expo Animation Showcase App has been enhanced to feature animations that function as overlays on game boards. This update ensures that animations complement gameplay rather than obscuring it, providing visual feedback while allowing players to continue interacting with the game.

## Overlay Animation Features

### Key Improvements
1. **Transparency Control**: All animations now use rgba/hsla colors with configurable opacity
2. **Positioning Options**: Animations can be positioned at center, top, or bottom of the screen
3. **Non-Interactive Behavior**: Animations use `pointerEvents: 'none'` to allow interaction with game elements underneath
4. **Z-Index Management**: Proper z-index ensures animations appear above game elements
5. **Edge-Only Mode**: For subtle visual indicators (available in the "You're On Fire" animation)

### Board Completed Animation
The Board Completed animation has been redesigned with a ripple effect that creates celebratory fireworks while maintaining visibility of the game board:

- **Ripple Wave Effect**: Creates a subtle expanding circle that draws attention without obscuring content
- **Particle System**: Transparent particles with configurable density and color schemes
- **Configurable Speed**: Adjust animation duration to match game pacing
- **Position Control**: Place the animation center point at different screen locations

### High Score Animation
The High Score animation now features a star burst effect with transparent elements and configurable positioning:

- **Star Particles**: Semi-transparent stars that burst from a central point
- **Celebratory Text**: "HIGH SCORE!" text with configurable opacity
- **Background Glow**: Subtle background effect that highlights achievement without blocking view
- **Intensity Control**: Adjust the number and size of stars based on achievement significance

### You're On Fire Animation
The On Fire animation has been completely redesigned to work as a non-intrusive overlay with edge effects:

- **Edge Flames**: Option to show flames only at screen edges for minimal gameplay disruption
- **Flame Particles**: Semi-transparent flame particles with configurable height and color
- **Smoke Effects**: Optional smoke particles with adjustable intensity
- **Edge-Only Mode**: Toggle between full screen and edge-only animations

## Implementation Details

### Transparency Implementation
All animations use rgba/hsla color formats with a configurable opacity parameter:
```typescript
// Example from BoardCompletedAnimation.tsx
color = `rgba(${r}, ${g}, ${b}, ${opacity})`;
```

### Positioning System
Animations can be positioned at different screen locations using a simple position prop:
```typescript
// Example positioning logic
switch (position) {
  case 'top':
    centerPosition = { x: width / 2, y: height * 0.25 };
    break;
  case 'bottom':
    centerPosition = { x: width / 2, y: height * 0.75 };
    break;
  case 'center':
  default:
    centerPosition = { x: width / 2, y: height / 2 };
}
```

### Non-Interactive Behavior
All animation containers use `pointerEvents: 'none'` to ensure they don't interfere with game interactions:
```typescript
<View style={[styles.container, { pointerEvents: 'none' }]}>
  {/* Animation elements */}
</View>
```

### Z-Index Management
Proper z-index values ensure animations appear above game elements:
```typescript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
    zIndex: 1000, // Ensure it's above game elements
  },
});
```

## Usage in Games

### Integration Steps
1. Import the desired animation component
2. Add it as a child of your game component
3. Control visibility with the `isPlaying` prop
4. Configure appearance with props like `position`, `opacity`, etc.

### Example Integration
```typescript
import { BoardCompletedAnimation } from '@/components/animations/BoardCompletedAnimation';

// In your game component
return (
  <View style={styles.gameContainer}>
    {/* Your game board and UI */}
    <GameBoard />
    <GameControls />
    
    {/* Overlay animation */}
    <BoardCompletedAnimation 
      isPlaying={levelCompleted}
      onAnimationComplete={handleAnimationComplete}
      position="center"
      opacity={0.8}
      speed={1.2}
      particles={40}
      colorScheme="Gold"
    />
  </View>
);
```

### Best Practices
- Use lower opacity values (0.6-0.8) for less intrusive animations
- Consider edge-only mode for the On Fire animation during active gameplay
- Position animations away from critical game elements
- Adjust particle counts and sizes based on device performance

## Testing
All animations have been tested with a mock game board to ensure they function properly as overlays. The animations maintain visibility of game elements while providing visual feedback to players.

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future versions:
- Responsive sizing based on device screen dimensions
- Additional positioning options (corners, custom coordinates)
- Animation combinations for complex game events
- Performance optimizations for lower-end devices
