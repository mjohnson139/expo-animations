# Expo Animation Showcase App Documentation

## Overview
The Expo Animation Showcase App is a mobile application built with Expo and React Native that allows users to browse, preview, and customize various animations for indie apps. The app features three main animations:

1. **Board Completed** - A celebratory fireworks animation for completing a board
2. **High Score** - An animation to celebrate achieving a high score
3. **You're On Fire** - An animation to show the user is on a winning streak

## App Structure

### Navigation
The app uses React Navigation with a tab-based layout:
- Home tab
- Animations tab (list of available animations)

Each animation in the list can be tapped to navigate to a detailed view with controls.

### Screens

- Animation title
- Brief description
- Animation type
- Visual indicator of the animation style

#### Animation Detail Screen
This screen provides a detailed view of a selected animation with:
- Animation preview area
- Play/Stop controls
- Detailed description
- Customizable parameters with interactive controls
- Type information

### Components

#### AnimationCard
A reusable component for displaying animation items in the list view with:
- Title
- Description
- Type indicator
- Icon based on animation type

#### AnimationControl
A reusable component for controlling animation parameters with:
- Slider controls for numeric values
- Option selectors for categorical values

#### Animation Components
Three custom animation components built with React Native Reanimated:

1. **BoardCompletedAnimation**
   - Particle-based fireworks effect
   - Customizable parameters:
     - Speed
     - Particle count
     - Color scheme (Rainbow, Gold, Blue, Custom)

     - Flame height
     - Flame color (Red-Orange, Blue, Green, Purple)
     - Smoke effect (None, Light, Heavy)

## Technical Implementation

### Libraries Used
- **Expo**: Core framework for the React Native app
- **React Navigation**: For screen navigation and tab layout
- **React Native Reanimated**: For creating fluid animations
- **Lottie React Native**: For supporting animation assets

### Animation Techniques
- **Particle Systems**: Used in Board Completed and On Fire animations
- **Color Interpolation**: For dynamic color transitions
- **Easing Functions**: For natural movement patterns
- **Animated Text**: For celebratory messages
- **Sequenced Animations**: For complex multi-stage effects

### Customization
Each animation includes multiple customizable parameters that can be adjusted in real-time using:
- Sliders for numeric values (speed, intensity, etc.)
- Option selectors for categorical values (color schemes, effects, etc.)

## User Experience
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Tab-based layout for easy access to animations
- **Interactive Controls**: Real-time adjustment of animation parameters
- **Visual Feedback**: Preview area shows animation changes immediately
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes and orientations

## Screenshots
Due to technical limitations with the development environment, actual screenshots could not be captured. However, the app includes:

1. **Home Screen**: Entry point with app information
2. **Animations List**: Grid of available animations with preview icons
3. **Board Completed Detail**: Fireworks animation with controls
4. **High Score Detail**: Star burst animation with controls
5. **You're On Fire Detail**: Flame animation with controls

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements could include:
- Additional animation types
- Export functionality to use animations in other apps
- Animation combination tools
- Custom animation creation interface
